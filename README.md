**# SocketAndroid**

This example is for connecting & real time data updating on Android using Node server with socket io.

Example contains Kotlin language instead of java for Android and the reference of this example is taken from https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-java as this is the library which provided the functionality for connecting android to node server.

**Socket library for node interaction in build.gradle**

implementation 'com.github.nkzawa:socket.io-client:0.5.2'



**Steps for nodes are on terminal :**

npm install http

npm install socket.io

node SocketToAndroid.js


**Code for node server :**

The code for backend is written in SocketAndroid.js file which is on project level. Its basically for simply connecting node to Android and updating data in every 1 secs.

Thank you for your time. :)
